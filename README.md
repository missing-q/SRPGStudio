# SRPGStudio
A short collection of scripts made for the SRPG Studio program.

## custom-itemcontrol.js
This script allows units with an item in the first slot of their inventory to counterattack with a linked weapon as specified in the custom parameter. This essentially allows for replication of Radiant Dawn staff counterattacking, but can be used for any other type of item. In order to use it, just add the custom parameter {linkwep:ID}, where ID is the numerical ID of a weapon in the Database (you can get weapon IDs by going to Tools>Options>Data and selecting "Display ID next to data name".
